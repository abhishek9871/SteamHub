I tested the dev server after the code changes you've made. What I observed is that on the home page, I clicked on a movie thumbnail in the popular movies or any section, and then I saw that the movie didn't load using the vidsrc.cc provider as well. And I kept on seeing the loading video loading video stuff. Then I searched for a movie Pathan and clicked on the thumbnail. And on the movie detail page, I clicked on watch now and observed that the same address might have moved away. Message is still being observed. So I need you to do a deep research using the Perplexity MCP, TavilY MCP, Serper MCP, and Firecrawl MCP and do research as of 4th October 2025 to find out all the information that you need to make all this fixed. And then fix this, please. Make all this seamless and ensure that no code regressions are there. The Hollywood movies play using the src.cc provider with perfection and with speed and the stream play stuff we are using for Hindi content must be there as well. And you have to think of the solutions and stuff like that and keep on using the deep research MCB tools such as Perplexity, Tavili, Firecrawl, and Serper so that you can find information from live internet and fix all the stuff. Be wise in this. Make sure everything is fixed.
