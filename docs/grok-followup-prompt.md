# Follow-Up Research Prompt for Grok

Thank you for the comprehensive research! I need to validate and refine your findings before implementation. Please address the following critical questions:

## 1. SmashyStream Verification (Your #1 Recommendation)

### Domain & URL Pattern Validation
You mentioned the domain as `embed.smashystream.com` with the URL pattern:
```
https://embed.smashystream.com/playere.php?tmdb={tmdbId}&autoplay=1
```

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**
- Please **verify this exact URL pattern works** by testing with these specific TMDB IDs:
  - **Pathaan (2023)**: TMDB ID = `700391`
  - **3 Idiots (2009)**: TMDB ID = `20453`
  - **RRR (2022)**: TMDB ID = `951491`
  
- Provide the **complete, working URL** for each example (copy-paste ready)
- Does the URL need to be `playere.php` or could it be different? (I see "Player D" mentioned - clarify this)
- Are there alternative URL patterns for SmashyStream? (e.g., `/embed/movie/`, `/v/`, etc.)

### TV Series Format
You provided:
```
https://embed.smashystream.com/playere.php?tmdb={tmdbId}&season={season}&episode={episode}&autoplay=1
```

**Test this with:**
- **Mirzapur Season 1 Episode 1**: TMDB ID = `82856`, Season = `1`, Episode = `1`
- Provide the complete working URL

### Mirror Domains
You listed mirrors as `smashystream.xyz` and `smashystream.lol`

**Verify:**
- Do these mirrors use the SAME URL pattern as the primary domain?
- Test the same Pathaan example on these mirrors and confirm they work
- Are there any other active SmashyStream mirrors in 2025?

### "Player D" Clarification
You mentioned "For Indian content, use 'Player D' option in embed (appended as &player=D or similar)"

**Clarify:**
- Is this parameter REQUIRED for Indian content or OPTIONAL?
- What's the exact parameter syntax: `&player=D` or something else?
- What happens if we DON'T use Player D for Indian content?
- Provide an example URL WITH and WITHOUT Player D for Pathaan

## 2. SuperEmbed Domain Confusion

You listed the domain as `multiembed.mov` but another research tool found `superembed.stream`

**CRITICAL:**
- Which is the correct PRIMARY domain in 2025?
- Test both domains with Pathaan (TMDB ID 700391) and confirm which works
- Are both domains valid, or is one a redirect/mirror?
- What's the exact working URL for each domain?

## 3. VidSrc.me vs VidSrc.in

You mentioned:
- Primary: `vidsrc.me`
- India-optimized: `vidsrc.in`

**Questions:**
- Does `vidsrc.in` support TMDB IDs or only IMDB IDs?
- You showed IMDB ID examples - can you provide TMDB ID examples?
- If vidsrc.me/vidsrc.in only supports IMDB IDs, we'd need conversion - is this correct?
- Test with Pathaan using both TMDB and IMDB IDs and show working URLs

### IMDB ID Requirement
If VidSrc.me requires IMDB IDs, provide:
- IMDB ID for Pathaan: (you need to find this)
- Working URL example: `https://vidsrc.me/embed/{imdb_id}?autoplay=1`

## 4. Embed-API Verification

Domain: `player.embed-api.stream`

**Verify:**
- Is this provider truly FREE in 2025? (you mentioned "Unclear free status")
- Test with Pathaan (TMDB ID 700391) and provide working URL
- Does it work from India without VPN?
- Any domain changes or rebranding in recent months?

## 5. Real-World Testing Requirements

For your TOP recommendation (SmashyStream), please verify:

### Accessibility Test
- Confirm it works from India (test from Indian IP if possible, or check forums)
- Confirm it works on these ISPs: Jio, Airtel, BSNL
- Any known ISP-level blocks or restrictions?

### Content Coverage Test
Please verify availability of these specific titles on SmashyStream:
- **Bollywood:** Pathaan, 3 Idiots, Dangal, Sholay
- **South Indian:** RRR, KGF, Baahubali, Pushpa (all with Hindi dubbing)
- **Web Series:** Sacred Games, Mirzapur, Special Ops

**For each title:**
- Confirm available: Yes/No
- Quality available: 720p / 1080p / 4K
- Has Hindi dubbing (for South Indian films): Yes/No

### Quality & Performance
- Maximum resolution actually available (not just claimed)
- Average load time for Indian content
- Number of ad popups per video load
- Mobile compatibility (Android/iOS)

## 6. Integration Code Validation

Your provided code example:
```javascript
const getIndianMovieUrl = (tmdbId) => {
  return `https://embed.smashystream.com/playere.php?tmdb=${tmdbId}&autoplay=1`;
};
```

**Questions:**
- Is `tmdb` the correct parameter name or should it be `tmdb_id`, `id`, or something else?
- Should we include the Player D parameter by default? If yes, what's the syntax?
- Any additional required parameters (e.g., `&lang=hi` for Hindi)?

## 7. Comparison with Other Research

Another research tool recommended **letsembed.cc** as the top choice for Indian content. This provider was NOT in your list.

**Please investigate:**
- Does `letsembed.cc` exist and work?
- Test with Pathaan: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id=700391`
- How does it compare to SmashyStream for Indian content?
- Why was it not in your recommendations?
- If it works well, where would you rank it vs SmashyStream?

## 8. Red Flags & Reliability

For SmashyStream specifically:

**Verify:**
- Any recent downtime or domain seizures?
- Community reputation (Reddit r/Piracy, r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH)
- Last verified working date
- Any known malware or excessive ads?
- HTTPS support (SSL certificate valid?)

## 9. Fallback Priority Clarification

You recommended:
1. SmashyStream
2. SuperEmbed
3. VidSrc.me
4. vidsrc.cc or 2embed.to

**Question:**
- If SmashyStream fails for a specific Indian movie, should we:
  - Try SuperEmbed next, OR
  - Try vidsrc.cc (our existing Hollywood provider) next?
- What's the optimal fallback order specifically for Indian content?

## 10. TMDB to IMDB Conversion

Since some providers (VidSrc.me) may require IMDB IDs:

**Clarify:**
- Do we need to implement TMDB â†’ IMDB conversion?
- Can we get IMDB ID from TMDB API response? (provide example)
- Or is it better to stick with TMDB-only providers?

## Expected Response Format

Please provide your answers in this format:

[Continue for each provider...]
```

## Final Request

**Most Important:** Provide actual working URLs that I can test RIGHT NOW with real TMDB IDs. Theory doesn't help - I need proven, tested, copy-paste-ready URLs that will play Pathaan when embedded in an iframe.

If you cannot verify these details with actual testing, please clearly state "UNVERIFIED" for that provider and lower its recommendation ranking accordingly.

Thank you!
