# Follow-Up Research Prompt for Perplexity

Thank you for the detailed research! I need to validate your findings, especially your top recommendation (letsembed.cc), before implementation. Please address these critical validation questions:

## 1. letsembed.cc Verification (Your #1 Recommendation)

### Domain & URL Pattern Testing
You provided these URL patterns:
- Movie: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id={tmdb_id}`
- TV: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/tv/?id={tmdb_id}/{season_number}/{episode_number}`

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION NEEDED:**
Please test these exact URLs with real TMDB IDs and confirm they work:

**Test Movies:**
- **Pathaan (2023)**: TMDB ID = `700391`
  - Expected URL: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id=700391`
  - Does it work? Yes/No
  - If No, what's the correct URL?

- **3 Idiots (2009)**: TMDB ID = `20453`
  - Expected URL: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id=20453`
  - Does it work? Yes/No

- **RRR (2022)**: TMDB ID = `951491`
  - Expected URL: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id=951491`
  - Does it work? Yes/No

**Test TV Series:**
- **Mirzapur S01E01**: TMDB ID = `82856`
  - Expected URL: `https://letsembed.cc/embed/tv/?id=82856/1/1`
  - Does it work? Yes/No
  - If No, what's the correct format?

### URL Format Clarification
Your examples show conflicting patterns:

**Pattern 1:** `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id={tmdb_id}` (with query parameter)
**Pattern 2:** `https://letsembed.cc/embed/tv/?id={tmdb_id}/{season}/{episode}` (mixed)

**Questions:**
- Is the TV URL correct? Should it be:
  - `?id={tmdb_id}&season={season}&episode={episode}` OR
  - `/embed/tv/{tmdb_id}/{season}/{episode}` OR
  - Something else entirely?
- Please provide the EXACT, TESTED, WORKING format for both movies and TV

### Provider Existence & Accessibility
**Critical validation:**
- When was letsembed.cc last verified to be working? (provide date)
- Is the domain currently accessible? (test and confirm)
- Does it load from India without VPN? (verify or cite source)
- Any recent domain changes or shutdowns?
- Alternative/mirror domains available?

### Claims Verification
You stated letsembed.cc is:
- "World's first embed API specifically designed for dubbed content"
- "Professional dubbing quality (not fan-made)"
- "Daily content updates"
- "Supports 50+ subtitle languages"

**Source verification needed:**
- Where did this information come from? (official website, documentation, GitHub?)
- Provide direct links to sources that confirm these claims
- Is there official documentation or API docs available?
- When was the provider launched? (you said it's "newer")

## 2. SuperEmbed Domain Confusion

You listed: `https://superembed.stream`
Another research tool found: `https://multiembed.mov`

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**
- Test BOTH domains with Pathaan (TMDB ID 700391)
- Which domain actually works in 2025?
- Are they the same service with different domains?
- Are both active, or is one outdated?

### Integration Complexity
You mentioned: "SuperEmbed requires custom player integration" and "Installation involves downloading their player script"

**This contradicts the requirement for simple iframe embedding!**

**Questions:**
- Can SuperEmbed be used with SIMPLE iframe embedding like vidsrc.cc?
- Or does it truly require custom JavaScript player installation?
- If it requires custom integration, it's NOT suitable for our use case - confirm this
- Provide an iframe embed example if possible, or confirm it's not iframe-compatible

## 3. Content Coverage Verification

You claimed these titles are available on letsembed.cc:

**Bollywood:**
- 3 Idiots (2009): ✅ Available
- Dangal (2016): ✅ Available  
- Pathaan (2023): ✅ Likely available
- Sholay (1975): ✅ Classic content available

**South Indian:**
- Baahubali (2015): ✅ Available with Hindi dubbing
- KGF (2018): ✅ Available with Hindi dubbing
- RRR (2022): ✅ Available with Hindi dubbing
- Pushpa (2021): ✅ Available with Hindi dubbing

**REQUEST:**
- How did you verify this? Did you actually test these URLs?
- Provide WORKING URLs for at least 3 of these titles
- If you didn't test, clearly state "BASED ON CLAIMS, NOT TESTED"

## 4. Comparison with Other Research

Another research tool recommended **SmashyStream** (`embed.smashystream.com`) as the #1 choice for Indian content. This provider was NOT in your report.

**Please investigate:**
- Does SmashyStream exist and work?
- Test URL pattern: `https://embed.smashystream.com/playere.php?tmdb={tmdb_id}&autoplay=1`
- Test with Pathaan (TMDB ID 700391): does it work?
- How does SmashyStream compare to letsembed.cc for Indian content?
- Why was SmashyStream not in your original research?
- If it works, how would you rank it vs letsembed.cc?

**Also investigate these providers mentioned by the other tool:**
- **VidSrc.me** (with vidsrc.in mirror for India)
- **Embed-API** (player.embed-api.stream)
- **multiembed.mov** (appears to be SuperEmbed under different domain)

Provide a comparison table of ALL providers (yours + theirs).

## 5. 8StreamApi Inclusion Issue

You included 8StreamApi as "Provider 3" even though you clearly marked it as:
- "⚠️ Archived/Discontinued (July 2025)"
- "Not maintained anymore"
- "No longer reliable for production use"
- "Verdict: 3/10 - Historical interest only"

**Question:**
- Why include a discontinued provider in recommendations?
- This wastes valuable research space - should be removed entirely
- Instead, should have researched more ACTIVE providers
- Please provide 2-3 additional ACTIVE Indian content providers to replace this

## 6. Free vs Paid Clarification

For letsembed.cc, you didn't clearly state whether it's:
- Completely free (like vidsrc.cc)
- Freemium (free with limits, paid for premium)
- Requires API key registration
- Requires account creation

**Clarify:**
- Is letsembed.cc 100% FREE with no API key required?
- Can it be used via direct iframe embedding without registration?
- Are there usage limits or rate limits?
- Any costs or restrictions we should know about?

## 7. Quality & Performance Verification

You claimed:
- "HD/4K with multiple servers"
- "Professional dubbing quality"

**Verify:**
- Maximum resolution actually available for Indian content (test with real examples)
- What percentage of content is in 4K vs HD vs SD?
- Load time for typical Bollywood movie (seconds)
- Number of ad popups or interruptions
- Mobile compatibility confirmed for Android/iOS

## 8. India ISP Accessibility

You stated: "Works across all major Indian ISPs"

**Verify:**
- Based on what source? Community reports? Testing?
- Any known blocks on Jio, Airtel, BSNL, Vi?
- Reddit/forum discussions confirming India accessibility?
- VPN requirement: Yes or No?
- Provide links to sources confirming India accessibility

## 9. Technical Integration Details

### iframe Embedding
You didn't provide clear iframe integration examples.

**Provide:**
```html
<!-- Complete iframe embed code for letsembed.cc -->
<iframe 
  src="[exact URL with Pathaan example]"
  [what attributes are needed? sandbox? allow?]
  [recommended width/height?]
  [any other required attributes?]
>
</iframe>
```

### Security Considerations
- Does letsembed.cc work with iframe sandbox restrictions?
- HTTPS support confirmed?
- CORS issues when embedding?
- Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility?

## 10. Fallback Strategy Validation

You recommended this fallback order:
1. letsembed.cc (for Indian content) / vidsrc.cc (for Hollywood)
2. SuperEmbed.stream
3. 2embed.to
4. vidsrc.to

**Questions:**
- If letsembed.cc fails for an Indian movie, should we try vidsrc.cc (our current provider) before SuperEmbed?
- You placed SuperEmbed as Tier 2, but if it requires custom player integration (not iframe), it's NOT suitable for fallback - confirm
- Suggest an optimized fallback order considering iframe-only requirement

## 11. Integration Code Validation

Your provided code:
```javascript
const getIndianMovieUrl = (tmdbId) => {
  return `https://letsembed.cc/embed/movie/?id=${tmdbId}`;
};

const getIndianTvUrl = (tmdbId, season, episode) => {
  return `https://letsembed.cc/embed/tv/?id=${tmdbId}/${season}/${episode}`;
};
```

**Test and correct:**
- Run this code with Pathaan (TMDB ID 700391)
- Does the generated URL work when embedded in iframe?
- Any additional parameters needed (autoplay, quality, language)?
- Provide COMPLETE, TESTED, WORKING code examples

## 12. Mirror Domains & Reliability

For letsembed.cc:

**Investigate:**
- Are there mirror/backup domains? (like vidsrc has .cc, .xyz, .in, .me)
- What happens if primary domain goes down?
- Community-known alternative domains?
- Domain stability history (any seizures, shutdowns, migrations?)

## 13. Content Request Feature

You mentioned: "Request missing content feature"

**Clarify:**
- Is this a manual request system (user submits request)?
- Or automatic (provider auto-adds content from TMDB)?
- Response time for content requests?
- This feature exists on letsembed.cc website - provide link

## 14. Dubbing vs Subtitles

For South Indian movies:

**Clarify:**
- Does letsembed.cc provide DUBBED (Hindi audio) versions?
- Or just original audio with Hindi SUBTITLES?
- Our users need DUBBED content - confirm this is available
- Provide example: RRR in Hindi dubbed audio (not just subtitles)

## 15. Source Attribution

You included footnotes [^1], [^2], [^3], [^4], [^5] but no actual references.

**Provide:**
- Full list of sources with URLs
- Official letsembed.cc website or documentation link
- Community discussions (Reddit, forums) mentioning letsembed.cc
- GitHub repositories or APIs related to letsembed.cc
- Any official announcements or blog posts

**This is critical for verifying your claims!**

```

## Final Critical Request

**I need PROOF, not CLAIMS:**

1. Provide working URLs for Pathaan that I can test in an iframe RIGHT NOW
2. Link to letsembed.cc official website or documentation
3. Community sources confirming it works from India
4. Test results from SmashyStream comparison
5. If you cannot verify with actual testing, clearly mark as "UNVERIFIED CLAIM"

The goal is to implement a provider that ACTUALLY WORKS - not one that sounds good in theory.

Please prioritize accuracy over optimism. If letsembed.cc cannot be verified, recommend the best VERIFIED alternative.

Thank you!
