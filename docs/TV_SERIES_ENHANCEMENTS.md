## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Basic states
const [content, setContent] = useState(null);
const [streamUrl, setStreamUrl] = useState(null);

// TV Series states
const [seasons, setSeasons] = useState([]);
const [currentSeason, setCurrentSeason] = useState(1);
const [currentEpisode, setCurrentEpisode] = useState(1);
const [episodes, setEpisodes] = useState([]);
const [watchedEpisodes, setWatchedEpisodes] = useState(new Set());

// Auto-play states
const [showNextEpisodePopup, setShowNextEpisodePopup] = useState(false);
const [nextEpisodeCountdown, setNextEpisodeCountdown] = useState(10);
```

### Episode Navigation Logic
```javascript
const getNextEpisode = () => {
  // Next episode in current season
  if (currentEpisode < episodes.length) {
    return { season: currentSeason, episode: currentEpisode + 1 };
  }
  
  // First episode of next season
  const nextSeason = seasons.find(s => s.season_number === currentSeason + 1);
  if (nextSeason) {
    return { season: currentSeason + 1, episode: 1 };
  }
  
  return null; // Series complete
};
```

### Watch Progress Tracking
```javascript
const markEpisodeWatched = (season, episode) => {
  const key = `${season}-${episode}`;
  const newWatched = new Set(watchedEpisodes);
  newWatched.add(key);
  setWatchedEpisodes(newWatched);
  
  // Persist to localStorage
  localStorage.setItem(`watched_${id}`, JSON.stringify([...newWatched]));
};

const isEpisodeWatched = (season, episode) => {
  return watchedEpisodes.has(`${season}-${episode}`);
};
```

### Auto-Play Countdown
```javascript
const startNextEpisodeCountdown = () => {
  let count = 10;
  setNextEpisodeCountdown(count);
  
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    count -= 1;
    setNextEpisodeCountdown(count);
    
    if (count <= 0) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      playNextEpisode();
    }
  }, 1000);
  
  autoPlayTimeoutRef.current = interval;
};
```
