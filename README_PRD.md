# PRD Documentation - Complete Package

## üìã Overview

I've created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) package for rebuilding your streaming application from scratch using an AI wipe coding tool. This package is designed to produce a **flawless, modern, bug-free application** that maintains your current technical integrations (TMDB API + vidsrc.cc) while delivering a stunning, ultra-modern UI/UX.

## üéØ How to Use This PRD Package

### For AI Wipe Coding Tools (Claude, Cursor, v0, Bolt.new, etc.)

**Step 1: Start with IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
This is your primary instruction file. Give this to the AI tool first as it contains:
- Clear phase-by-phase implementation order
- Critical technical requirements
- Exact code specifications

**Step 2: Reference PRD_OVERVIEW.md for details**
When the AI needs more context about:
- Design system specifics
- Complete architecture
- Success criteria
- Overall project scope

**Step 3: Use SPRINT_10_PLAYER_CRITICAL.md for player**
When implementing the video player (MOST CRITICAL):
- Show this file to ensure correct vidsrc.cc format
- Verify the exact URL structure
- Use the provided testing checklist

**Step 4: Use SPRINT_01_TO_05.md for foundation**
When setting up the project foundation:
- Complete service implementations
- Component library creation
- State management setup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Technical Points

### MUST MAINTAIN (DO NOT CHANGE):

1. **vidsrc.cc URL Format:**
   ```
   Movies: https://vidsrc.cc/v2/embed/movie/{TMDB_ID}?autoplay=1&autonext=1
   TV: https://vidsrc.cc/v2/embed/tv/{TMDB_ID}/{SEASON}/{EPISODE}?autoplay=1&autonext=1
   ```
   **Use TMDB ID, not IMDb ID**

2. **TMDB API Integration:**
   ```
   Base: https://api.themoviedb.org/3
   API Key: From .env file (REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY)
   Images: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/{size}/{path}
   ```

3. **No Backend:**
   - 100% frontend application
   - localStorage for persistence
   - No server-side code

   - Not critical for v1

7. **LOW - Settings (Sprint 12)**
   - Can be minimal
   - Add later
